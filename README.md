## What is Mercadix?

Mercadix helps you quickly understand the price landscape for any product on Mercado Libre (Argentina & Brasil). Simply search for an item, and Mercadix generates a clear histogram showing the range of prices currently listed. This allows you to see the minimum, maximum, average, and median prices at a glance, helping you make informed decisions.

**No technical knowledge required!** Just type what you're looking for.

## How it Works (Simplified)

Mercadix searches Mercado Libre for the product you entered, collects the prices from the listings, and then uses statistical analysis and graphing tools (like Matplotlib) to create the visual price summary. It also uses the [monedas-api](https://github.com/pyoneerC/monedas-api) for optional currency conversion insights (though the primary display is in local currency).
