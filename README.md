## Description

This project is a web application built with **Flask** that allows users to search for product prices on MercadoLibre and visualize them in a histogram. It uses web scraping to collect price data, the [monedas-api](https://github.com/pyoneerC/monedas-api) (also developed by me) for real-time currency conversion to USD, and **Matplotlib** to generate clean, insightful graphs that illustrate price variability.
